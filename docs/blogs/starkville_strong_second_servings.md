# Hi!

In this post, I wanted to spotlight a local Starkville organization:  
[Starkville Strong](https://www.starkvillestrong.org/)

Starkville Strong is a local nonprofit providing support for Starkville residents to help with food insecurity, homelessness, housing insecurity and community advocacy. 
Among their numerous programs ([list here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18nR-slleTjSRDjOOFM1v2-gQiSewUiZsspybvK6sNxE/edit?tab=t.0)) is the [Second Servings](https://www.starkvillestrong.org/upcoming-events-1) initiative, which funnels food that would otherwise be wasted into nutrional meals that are given to those that need them in the community through various means.

Since its inception, many thousands of meals have been prepared and saved dozens of tons of food from being wasted. 
I have helped with this initiative on a number of occasions, and it is one I wholeheartedly standby as a pure benefit to the community. 

If you need food, please reach out to Starkville Strong to find out more.  
If you have surplus food or funds and want to help the community, please reach out to see how you can do that.

Heck, you can email me at drpepperdalton@gmail.com if you want.
I will help you however I can. 

Have a great day,  
Dalton
